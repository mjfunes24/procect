	 <p>My hobbies are dancing, singing. My Favorite subject is math. I learned how to 
	 play the guitar im my school when I was in 7th grade. I used to be in the church 
	 choir. My mom calls me gringa because I hear a lot of music in English. I have always
	  like using computers. I got my first cell phone when I was 8 , anf my first computer 
	  when I was in 5t grade. That's why I join computer science. I love reading. My first 
	  book was Twilight. It they first book I read outside of school. After that I have 
	  read more than 20 books. I have read books in my computer and my phone too. I love 
	  wattpad. I love hearing music. My taste in music is unique, depending on my mood.
	  But if I had to pick a favorite artist, it would be Demi Lovato</p>
