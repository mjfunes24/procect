	  <h2>Carrer Derscription</h2>
	  
	  <p>Civil engineering is a professional engineering that deals with  designs, 
	  construction, maintenance, of the physical and naturally built environment.  
	  â€œAccording to the American Society of Civil Engineers, the scope of the 
	  profession is "the design and maintenance of public works such as roads, 
	  bridges, water and energy systems as well as public facilities like ports, 
	  railways and airports.".  Also you need to have skills using Auto-Cad ann 
	  Microsoft Office Programs.</p>

	  <h3>Education Required</h3>

	   <p>Typically possess  academic degree. The length of study is five years. 
	   The completed degree is designed as  a bachelor in engineering. They start
	   by enrolling in chemistry, physics and advanced math courses. They also need 
	   Design Project class. They need to have laboratory courses to learn of the
	   materials that they are going to use.</p>

	  <h3>Task</h3>
	  
	  <p>The task of this career include design buildings & bridges. They also
	  design  space Stations, Airports and jet, Seaports, Energy Systems. They 
	  also need to have a good judgment of the estimate of the cost to build the 
	  certain project. Railroads, roads, and subways are design by these engineers 
	  too.</p>

	  <h3>Jobs</h3>
	   <p>Most of the Civil Engineers work a office buildings, Laboratories, and 
	   Industrial Plants. Others work in the open. When they work in office they
	   only design that they are required. When they work  in laboratories they 
	   test the materials that constructors use.</p>

	  <h3>Salary</h3>
	  
	  <p>Civil engineers earn a salary of $82,220. The lowest paid engineer has a 
	  salary of $52,900 , and the highest paid engineer had a salary of 129,850.</p>

	  <h3>Relation with Computer Science</h3>
	  
	  <p>Civil Engineers can design with programs in the computer. Those programs
	  are specialized for the use of 3-D drawings that are used for the designs.
	  One of the most popular program that Civil Engineers use is called Auto-Cad.
